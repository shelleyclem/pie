/* 
* Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    - mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin access to selected resources from a different origin


1. a response header that tells the browser to allow code from any origin
2. a response header that specifies the method or methods allowed when accessing the resource to a preflight request.
3. a response header that's used in response to a preflight request that indicates which HTTP headers can be used during the actual request. 

* Preflight Requests: 
    - A preflight request is a CORS request that checks to see if the CORS protocol is understood.
    - automatically issued by a browser. 
    ex: client might ask a server if it would allow a DELETE request before actually sending the DELETE request.
