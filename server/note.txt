npm start vs npm dev

npm start: 
    - When running the npm start comman from the root directory of the project, node will look for a 'scripts' object in the package.json file. Once found with the key 'start', it will run the command that is specified as its value.

npm dev: 
    - indicates taht we're running the project in development mod and we're using 'nodemon' to do so.
        - nodemon allows us to make changes without having to restart the server after each change. 

node modules:
    - packages that npm installs that allow our applicaiton and all of its dependencies to run properly. 

package-lock.json  
    - locks in the version of hte packages that we're using. 
    - version control syste that acts as a failsafe.

Express 
    - lightweight web application framework used to help organize our application into a MVC architecture within our server. 
        MVC: Model View Controller
    - Not a model view controller framework by itself. Still need to use our own ORM (object-relational mapping) library.
